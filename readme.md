# RICH Protocol: Reinforced Intelligent Consensus Hub

## Overview
The **RICH Protocol** integrates decentralized federated learning, blockchain-based consensus, and model optimization techniques to create a tokenized ecosystem where GPU compute resources and AI models become strategic digital assets. By combining efficient AI training with an economic system powered by $rich tokens, the protocol not only optimizes AI agent deployment across heterogeneous edge devices but also incentivizes participants through a staked token mechanism.

This project features the following:
- **Decentralized Federated Learning** for collaborative training.
- **Model Pruning & Compression** to adapt AI models for edge devices.
- **Staked Token Mechanism** for fair and transparent model aggregation and resource allocation.
- **Tokenized GPU Capacity** to enable scalable AI compute access through $rich token staking.
- **Multiple AI Models** for diverse applications, including NLP, time-series data, and computer vision.

## Key Features of the Protocol

### 1. **Tokenized Compute and AI Model Access**
Participants can stake $rich tokens to gain proportional access to GPU capacity and AI model resources. Token staking not only provides access to computing resources but also ensures fair participation in the federated learning process.

### 2. **Decentralized Federated Learning**
- Local edge devices optimize AI models using local data without exposing sensitive information.
- Models are updated on the server through a secure aggregation mechanism.

### 3. **Staked Token Voting and Consensus**
- A voting system using staked $rich tokens assigns weights to model contributions, ensuring transparent aggregation.
- Aggregated updates form a **Consensus AI Agent**, progressively improving accuracy and performance.

### 4. **Model Pruning & Compression**
- **Pruning** reduces unimportant model parameters to optimize efficiency.
- **Compression** minimizes storage and computational overhead for edge deployment.

### 5. **Heterogeneous Device Support**
- Models adapt to device-specific characteristics for efficient training and deployment, ensuring inclusivity across diverse hardware environments.

## How to Use

### 1. **Stake $rich Tokens (Optional)**
To participate in the weighted voting mechanism and gain access to GPU capacity, users can stake $rich tokens through the protocol's staking interface (future integration planned). This will:
- Determine the user's weight in the model aggregation process.
- Provide proportional GPU capacity for AI training or inference tasks.

### 2. **Set Up the Server**
The server manages the global model, aggregates updates, and coordinates the training process. Run the following command to start the server:

```bash
python server.py
```

### 3. **Configure Clients**
Each client trains the model locally using its own data, prunes and compresses it, and uploads the updates back to the server. Run the following command on each edge device:

```bash
python client.py --model <model_name> --data_path <path_to_local_data>
```

Example:
```bash
python client.py --model cnn_agent --data_path ./data/local_images
```

### 4. **Orchestrate Federated Learning**
`main.py` coordinates the overall process, including model distribution, client training, and global aggregation:

```bash
python main.py --rounds <num_rounds> --clients <num_clients>
```

Example:
```bash
python main.py --rounds 10 --clients 5
```
